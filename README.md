# ðŸ‘‘ RexBDD: Reduction-on-Edge Complement-and-Swap Binary Decision Diagram, DAC'24

Next-gen BDD framework combing widely used features and ensuring canonicity.
<!-- This library supports several types of binary decision diagrams (BDDs), including reduced ordered BDDs, zero-suppressed BDDs, and BDDs integrating multiple reduction rules, complement, and swap flags. -->

## ðŸ’¡ What is this?

We introduced RexBDDs, which canonically combine **nine** reductions (including those of the two most well-known BDD variants, [Bryant86's FBDDs](https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1986.1676819) and [Minato01's ZBDDs](https://doi.org/10.1007/s100090100038)) with complement and swap flags. Benchmark experiments confirm that RexBDDs encode many boolean functions using substantially fewer nodes than any other BDD variant, and tend to have much better runtimes.

## ðŸ“¦ How to build?

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is required to build.
1. Set up the build files:
    ```
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    ```
2. Now start to build:
   ```
   $ make
   ```
   Library will be in ```build/src/```. Test and example applications in ```build/tests/``` and ```build/examples/```. This may be sufficient for most users.
3. Remove the results of compilation:
   ```
   $ make clean
   ```

## To-Do List

- [ ] Support relational matrix nodes.
- [ ] Support more general reduction rules with multi-terminals.

abstract = {We introduce RexBDDs, binary decision diagrams (BDDs) that exploit reduction opportunities well beyond those of reduced ordered BDDs, zero-suppressed BDDs, and recent proposals integrating multiple reduction rules. RexBDDs also leverage (output) complement flags and (input) swap flags to potentially decrease the number of nodes by a factor of four. We define a reduced form of RexBDDs that ensures canonicity, and use a set of benchmarks to demonstrate their superior storage and runtime requirements compared to previous alternatives.},
